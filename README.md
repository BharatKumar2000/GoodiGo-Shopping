# GoodiGo

**GoodiGo** is a shopping application for Computer components, developed for the Android platform. The app targets devices with Android v4.0 (API 16) and above.

The app allows users to purchase a wide variety of computer components, ranging from core components like monitors and motherboards to accessories like keyboards, mice and connectors. Components are distributed category wise and presented to the user in a grid view for convenience of operation. Users can browse any category separately and select items they would like to purchase by adding them to a cart. This cart is editable and users may remove items from the same anytime.

To make a purchase, however, the user must register themselves on the app. The credentials and user data are maintained using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which allows for seamless operation even when the device is offine for a brief time period. Once registered, users can continue to edit the cart and save their order to edit it later, or proceed towards specifying shipment details and payment. The app records the most recent address used by the user so as to save time while completing the order. Once the order is placed, users can track the order's process and view the order's location when it is out for delivery. 

Apart from orders, the app allows users to view saved details like addresses and previous orders.

Users can also contact customer care directly via the app, through call or e-mail.
